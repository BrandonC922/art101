	Overall there were no challenges to this assignment. It was very straight forward
	and similar to what we had done in class.

	<p1>
		A really simple syntax error messed me up for like a solid hour but it was really
		not that big of a deal. I forgot to write document in one of the lines of code.It was
		really frustrating but eventually it all worked out. Everything else went smoothly.
