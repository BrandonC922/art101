		Lab 3 File Structures <br>
		</h1>
	<p1>
		The idea of this lab was to further create a
		local file structure on my computer and add index.html files.
	</p1>

	<h1>
		Challenges <br>
		</h1>
	<p1> There were not any significant challenges for me.
		I knew how to do majority of the things and everything else
	I was able to find out how to do on  W3Schools.</p1>

	<h1>
		Results
	</h1>
	<p1>
	Here is the file structure that we made <br>
