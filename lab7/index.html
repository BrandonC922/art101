		Challenges
	</h1>

	<p1>
	There wasn't anything too challenging with this lab. The hardest part was making
	sure all the variable names matched up within each new line of code. Besides
	that everything went smoothly enough.

		Problems <br>
	</h1>

	<p1>
		Variable names were hard to keep consistent sometimes. I had a lot of problems
		trying to reference other variables because the capitalization was off. Eventually it
		all worked out so it wasn't that bad.
