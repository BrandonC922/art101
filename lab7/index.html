		Challenges

	<p1>
	There was no real challenging part for me on this lab. It seems really close
	to Lab 5. So any issues I figured out on that Lab.

		Problems <br>
	</h1>

	<p1>
		No problems. Everything went smoothly this time. I mainly pushed myself to
		try a new background. Hopefully the background is changing colors when you look at it.
