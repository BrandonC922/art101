	<p1>
	This lab wasn't too challenging. We did the exact same type of problem in Class
	so it was mainly trying to recreate what we had done. There was a bit of trial and error
	but in the every task was completed.

	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>
	<p1>
		I had a problem with the divs starting out being changed when I loaded my html.
		They would already be different colors and fonts. I had assigned the class in the html
		instead of the javascript so it was opening with the css already in place. Eventually
		I realized this and fixed it. Besides that there were no other problems.
