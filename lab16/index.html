	<h2>
		Challenges

	<p1>
	There was nothing that was particularly challenging about this assignment. Everything
	worked out the way we thought it would. A lot of the code we just borowed from the previous
	assignment so we completed this one quite quickly.

	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>

	<p1>
		There were no problems for me for this lab. It was very similar to the last lab so we didn't have any issues.
