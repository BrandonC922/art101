		Challenges
	</h2>

	<p1>
	For getting this particular API and set up it wasn't hard. It is basically what we did in class, I just
	had to find a new site and information and input that. It was a struggle figguring out how to get some of the other sites
	to work. I wasn't sure how to find the information besides the URL.
	</p1>

	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>

	<p1>
		I couldn't figure out how to get the fortune cookie site to work. I didn't know how to access the information
		needed for that site. I tried different combinations based on what the site said, but nothing worked the way it needed too.
