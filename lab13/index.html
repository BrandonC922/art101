		Lab 13: Loops <br>
	</h1>
	<h2>
		Challenges
	</h2>
	<p1>
	This lab was challenging, it was a lot of trial and error trying to get the
	bonus task to work. We referenced a lot from Prof. Wes page and went back and fourth
	trying to figure out how to fix ours everytime it messes up.
	</p1>
	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>
	<p1>
		The main problem in this one was trying to figure out how to get the css to get
		all the outputs into one div that looked neat. I wasn't able to figure it out so I settled
		for giving each individual element it's own nice look. The obvious downfall here is that it is
		a lot of scrolling if you put in a big number.
