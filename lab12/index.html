		Lab 12: Conditionals <br>
	</h1>

	<h2>
		Challenges
	</h2>
	<p1>
	This lab was challenging, but I feel it was challenging for the wrong reasons.
	I had tried to do the simple versions of some of these tasks but it didn't work.
	With my partner I got it to work but not the way I wanted.
	</p1>
	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>
	<p1>
		For whatever reason using the $ short cut made my code not work. I'm not sure
		if it's not meant to be used here or something was wrong with my sources but any time
		I tried there was an error in the inspector source. It said things about null values
		and can't define .addeventlistener function.
