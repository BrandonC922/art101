	<p1>
	This lab took quite a while for me. I understood what I had to do just not
	exactly how to make the code do it. It was a lot of trial and error trying
	to get that last line of code to come out of the function. I had the variable
	it just wouldn't print for the longest time.

		Problems <br>
	</h1>

	<p1>
		I had no clue how to get the final answer to appear in my results. I was used
		to doing appendchild but it wasn't working here. I took me a while to figure out
		how to get around that. Eventually I realized innerHTML was the way I was supposed to do it.
