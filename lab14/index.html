	<p1>
	For the most part all my Labs worked they way they were intended to work. The only one that I had to go back to was
	Lab 12. It worked but it didn't use Jquery for the JS so I went back and updated it.
	</p1>

	<h2>
		Problems <br>
	</h2>

	<p1>
		I had a problem with the using JQuery. I couldn't get the results to print out. For
		a while I had no clue what it was because the console didn't raise an error. Eventualy
		it was figured out that the syntax of the JQuery was wrong, once that was fixed everything worked.
